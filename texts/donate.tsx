    <p>Developing Bloben is my hobby and not source of income, so you are free to use it if you find application useful.
   <br/><br/>
    Formerly I offered Bloben as service on my server, but decided to continue only as self hosted project so this cut some costs. If anyone will still want to donate, I offer few options through Bitcoin, Patreon or Buy me coffee
   Thank you!</p>
