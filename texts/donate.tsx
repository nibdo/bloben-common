    <p>Everything is free and I would love,
   if you will try and use Bloben Calendar. This is hobby project for my personal use and learning with no guarantees, but it will make me happy, if some of you will find it useful for your daily tasks.

   Operational costs are not that much for now, just a few Euro for VPS server, domain and mail service each month, but if you want to support me, you can make donation with Buy me coffee service or send me donation in Bitcoin. <br/> <br/>
   Thank you!</p>
